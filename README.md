# ZweLess v2.0.0

**ZweLess** is a [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) library that includes a lot of mixins and variables to help you styling a website. 
Nowadays there are a lot of different browsers, each with its set of prefixed properties and incompatibilities. 
**ZweLess** tries (and we can say succeded quite well) to think about that for you, saving you time to enjoy the styling process and enhance your creativity. 

A keen eye could easily see that a lot of the code of **ZweLess** is taken from [Preboot](http://getpreboot.com/) and from [Less Hat](http://lesshat.com/). 
Of course all the credit for that goes to their creators, I've just put it in a single library, trying to make it better and more flexible.

## Installation

Start using **ZweLess** is really easy: just [download](https://github.com/Zweer/zwe-less/archive/master.zip) the project, copy the whole less directory into your website folder and include the `zwe.less` file: `@import "zwe";`.
Now you can start using all the mixins and variables provided by **ZweLess**
