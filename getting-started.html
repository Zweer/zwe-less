<h2 id="what-is-zweless">What is ZweLess?</h2>

<p>
    ZweLess is a collection of
    <a href="http://lesscss.org" target="_blank">Less</a> mixins and classes
    that provide a big help to designers and coder which want to stylize their
    sites quickly.
</p>

<p>
    To use ZweLess at its full power you have to understand and talk
    <a href="http://lesscss.org" target="_blank">Less</a> to use all the mixins
    the library provide.
    <br>
    You'll quickly see that everything is organized in a OO way, so that
    everything is exactly where you expect it to be.
</p>

<p>
    Moreover ZweLess wants (or better tries) to be an example of good OO css
    programming, taking in action all the experience we have built in years of
    web development.
</p>

<h2 id="what-zweless-is-not">What ZweLess is not (and never will be)?</h2>

<p>
    ZweLess doesn't want to be a complete framework with also javascript and
    templates in it. We leave that to the incredible
    <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Also ZweLess doesn't want to be the Bible of css programming (if we can call
    it "programming") or styling. Again, we leave it to bigger projects with
    more people and a wider audience.
</p>

<h2 id="download-zweless">Download ZweLess</h2>

<p>
    ZweLess could be used in many ways, each with its very flexibility. Be aware
    that not everyone may have the knowledge or resources to use a way or
    another.
</p>

<h3 id="compiled-css">Compiled CSS</h3>

<p>
    The easiest way to use this library is to download the compiled CSS. In this
    way you can benefit all the resets and settings made for you, without using
    <a href="http://lesscss.org" target="_blank">Less</a> or other
    pre-processors.
</p>

<p>
    Obviously in this way you'll not take benefits from the power of
    <a href="http://lesscss.org" target="_blank">Less</a> and the universe of
    mixins the library provides.
